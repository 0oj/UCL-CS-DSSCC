# UCL CS DSSCC
Managing concerns raised by students studying Computer Science at UCL.

- The basic idea is to manage concerns raised by students through **GitHub issues** because it is a great tool.
- Students can raise concerns, propose solutions or improvements, and engage in discussions.
- Representatives will monitor the repository and act upon the issues (and hopefully close them soon).
- The repository is public because it should be.
